Repository of Optical Controls and Experimental code.

It should be noted that this code was not designed to run without the nessisary hardware installed on teh host computer.

The Shaper2D program is designed to control a multidimentional optical experiment. In particular, gerneation of RF-frequenct signals for arbitrary waveform generation is a main component of this program.
